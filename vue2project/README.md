Self-taught frontend developer. Tim Conroy vue2project

Installation of necessary modules for the project build: 

1. You will need node.js.  https://nodejs.org/en/
2. With node installed you will now have access to `npm`. This is the node package manager. 
3. There are two versions of Vue.js. I highly recommend learning Vue2.x first.  https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/  
4. My code editor is Visual Studio Code (VSCode)   https://code.visualstudio.com/download  
5. I use Gitbash and Github.
